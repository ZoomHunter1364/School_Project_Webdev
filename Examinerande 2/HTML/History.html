  <center><h1 class="Title">A Small Description Of The History Of The Internet</h1></center>
  <h4 class="Sub_title">How It All Began</h4>
  <p class="Text">The history of the internet begins in 1962 with the USA getting spooked by the USSRs advancements in their space program, which lead the US military to start researching new ways of communications that would be able to function even after nuclear attack from the USSR which ended in them pursuing the idea of establishing a network of computers and terminals that would be able to communicate with each other over varying distances. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This would later expand into giving governmental staff, more specifically scientists, a way to transfer data to others without the need for personnel to either physically travel to the device of interest, or the need to send magnetic data tapes through conventional mail services. 
    <br>
    <br>
    This would later develop into something called ARPANET, which is short for ”U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency Network”. ARPANET is essentially the first public computer network and the forerunner to the internet, it was first established in 1969 for mainly academic and research purposes up until the year it was decommissioned, 1989. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Sometime during the 1970s a new means of communication through the internet was introduced where people would send and receive simple messages through the ARPANET system. This would later make the basis of the modern Email application which would explode in popularity during the mid 1990s when the first email hosting service first appeared. 
    </p>
  
    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Development Of The Internet In Sweden</h4>
    <p class="Text">A decade prior to that,during the 1960s, a man by the name of Björk Eriksen would succeed in establishing Sweden's first top domain (.Se) and later on the first website that used the .se address (Enea.Se). During this time period Björk would personally manage and monitor the various domains that use the .se address, as well as personally approve and decline requests for the usage of the address. This made it essentially impossible for private people to own a domain name, and was instead an exclusive feature to companies. He would later in 1997 sign a contract that would give the rights to his domain and its work to the internet foundation.</p>
  
    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Establishment Of The World Wide Web</h4>
    <p class="Text">Towards the end of of 1980s, a British scientist named Tim Berners-Lee would go on to create the World Wide Web while working in the esteemed CERN organisation with the purpose of meeting the demands for  automated information-sharing between scientists and researchers in different universities, institutes and organizations around the world. The concept of the World Wide Web would go on to be revised and improved many times, getting closer and closer to its modern definition. Eventually it would be moved from the original NeXT platform based browser, that few had access to, to the new, simpler and more accessible Line-mode browser. Berners-lee would soon after announce the existence of the server to several internet newsgroups which would spread interest in the project around the world. Following this announcement Berner-Lee would go on to request the help of more and more developers to come and expand the World Wide Web by creating more web browsers, most being written in the X-Windows System making the World Wide Web more accessible to the public. By the time of the 1990s the internet was mainly used by the public to share information, play games and even shop online. </p>
          
    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Internet Reaches All Corners Of The World</h4>
    <p class="Text">With the increased interest of the internet and World Wide Web, more and more people started to participate in its usage. So much so that the Christmas present of the year is said to be the “Internet” / A Subscription to the internet (The Swedish word used in some sources is “Abonnemang” for some reason). 1996 would also be the year that CSS was introduced, creating a new era of website design and development that would result in the launch of Google in 1998 and other infamous websites such as facebook and the increased popularity of the “Trojan Room Coffee Pot” webcam, which would lead to the an exponential growth of global culturalism and connectivity between various types of people and communities, making the internet the infamous phenomenon it is.
