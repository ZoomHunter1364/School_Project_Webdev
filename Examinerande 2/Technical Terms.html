<h1>The OSI Model</h1>


<h4 class="Sub_title">What is the OSI model and what does it reflect?</h4>
  <p class="Text"> 

    OSI stands for “Open System Interconnection” and is a model that consists of 7 layers that computer systems use to navigate through a network. The OSI model is most commonly used as reference to understand network communication, troubleshooting and development of network technologies. In practice, simplified models that consist of fewer layers  are implemented into many modern networks and protocols. 
    </p>
    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Seven Layers Of The OSI Model</h4>
    <p class="Text">
      
      1.  Physical: Has the role of transmitting raw bits (Information/Input) through a physical medium such as a CAT 6 cable or a fiber connection.
      <br>
      <br>
      2. Data Link: Has the role of transferring data in the form of “Frames” within a LAN network. In Addition, it's also responsible for ensuring reliable transfer of said data including error detection (CRC) with the help of MAC addresses. It should however be noted that it Detects errors and does not  correct the error. 
      <br>
      <br>
      3.  Network: Has the role of managing the addressing and routing of the datapacks between WAN networks. Internet protocols such as IPv4 and IPv6 are used to control how data is received and sent out, with routing protocols like EIGRP. 
      <br>
      <br>
      4.  Transport: Has the role of establishing reliable data transfer, communication and flow control through segmentation and reassembling of data, ensuring that all data is transferred properly. This is achieved by protocols such as TCP and UDP. 
      <br>
      <br>
      5.  Session: Has the role of managing sessions and/or connections between various applications through the use of port numbers.  
      <br>
      <br>
      6.  Presentation: Has the role of determining the format of data, deciding how its presented. This is also where data encryption occurs. HTTPS has for example a request and response structure between a client and server. 
      <br>
      <br>
      7. Application: This is where human input/interaction occurs through websites. HTTP data to end-users/Clients is provided in this layer.
      </p>
  
      <h1 class="Points">The Server-Client-Model</h1>
      <h4 class="Sub_title">The Role Of A Server</h4>
    <p class="Text"> The role of a server in a “Server-Client-Model” most commonly consists of being a provider of data, services and resources in general to the client, who interacts with the server to access said material. In addition, the role of the server is to handle client requests such as a URL for a website or the downloading of an online file and to process the request and respond appropriately with the requested resources. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Role Of A Client And Its Differnece From A Server</h4>
    <p class="Text">A client can be seen as a device or software application that requires a service or resource of sorts from another device and/or application to function, most commonly provided through a network. In the Client-Server-Model, the Client is the device/application that initiates communication with a server to access data, services  and resources. The client essentially acts as an interface for the user, allowing them to interact with the services provided by the server. The main difference between them can be summarized in the following:

      The client's role consists of requesting a server to provide them with services and resources and it awaits for a response by the server. An example of this is a web browser sending a HTTP request (Essentially a URL) to a web server to retrieve a webpage like youtube. 
      
      The role of a server is to respond and provide the client with the requested resources/services and await incoming requests by clients and respond accordingly. Like providing the client a webpage in response to a HTTP request.
