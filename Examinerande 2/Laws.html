  <h4 class="Sub_title">What GDPR Is And Its Principles</h4>
  <div class="GDPR">
  <p class="Text">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a Data Privacy and Security Law that was legislated in 2016 and made obligatory in 2018. It is to be followed by all entities that collect any and all data related to people within the European Union (EU). It is said to be the world's toughest security law, with anyone found in violation of the law receiving massive fines reaching into the tens of millions of euros or 4% of whatever global revenue a legal entity would make annually. The Law has 7 principles that make up its foundation for the protection of all data related to people within the EU. They are: 
    <br>
    <br>
    Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: Lawful, Transparent and Fair processing of all data related to subjects. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Purpose Limitation: Any and all processing of data must have legitimate purposes that are specified to the subject that the data is extracted from.
    <br>
    <br>
    Data minimization: Only a necessary amount of data is allowed to be collected and processed for the specified purpose.
    <br>
    <br>
    Accuracy: Any and all personal data should be accurate and up to date.
    <br>
    <br>
    Storage Limitation: Any and all personally identifying data should only be stored for as long as necessary for the specific purpose.
    <br>
    <br>
    Integrity And Confidentiality: Appropriate security, caution and confidentiality should be in place when processing data.
    <br>
    <br>
    Accountability: The entity in charge of the processing and usage of the collected data is responsible to be in compliance with the GDPR and its principles.

    <h4 class="Sub_title">Swedens Laws Of Electronic Communications</h4>
    <p class="Text">The Laws Of Electronic Communication of Sweden consists of a combination of national laws, international treaties and regulations from the EU that come together to regulate and protect the electronic communication of its citizens from bad actors that try to pry into their privacy, security, communications and data. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Among the Laws that govern Sweden's stance towards how the data of its citizens should be handled, are the following key laws that make up the foundation.
      </p>
  
    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Swedish Electronic Act (LEK)</h4>
    <p class="Text">The Electronic Communication Act is seen as the main component of Sweden's Electro communication laws and is based on the EUs Telecom Package along with the Unions regulations related to telecommunications. The law regulates the provision of telecommunication services such as the internet and other mobile services, along with setting up the foundation of market competition, the rights and responsibilities of service providers and consumer protection. The Act mainly covers Consumer protection as well as privacy of users in use of electronic communications. Licensing of telecom providers and the security and reliability of Networks. 
    </p>
          
    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Swedish Data Protection Act</h4>
    <p class="Text">The Swedish Data Protection Act is essentially the nation's understanding and implementation of the GDPR, with the act influencing the regulation of the processing of personal data. The law has the purpose of protecting individuals personal data from bad actors, as well as ensuring that legal entities such as providers and companies follow the privacy laws. It's applicable to pretty much the same areas as the GDPR is.   </p>
              
    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Swedish Act On Electronic Signature</h4>
    <p class="Text">The Act On Electronic Signature is a law that makes the process of signing off on contracts, legal documents and transactions through digital means, legal and binding as though they were signed off via pen and paper. It's pretty much the same as the EUs eIDAS regulation.</p>

    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Telecommunication Privacy Act</h4>
    <p class="Text">The Telecommunications Privacy Act is a law that makes up the foundation of the right to not have private communications be secretly recorded or surveillance by third parties, which in turn establishes the limits of the government's surveillance when it comes to issues like national security and investigations. In practice, the law ensures that no private calls, emails and other forms of communication are allowed to be recorded secretly without content of all parties involved, the law is applicable to all, even governmental bodies in the case that they do not have a court ordered subpoena. </p>

    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Swedish Post And Telecom Authority</h4>
    <p class="Text">The Post and Telecom Authority (PTS) is a regulatory body that is responsible for ensuring that all telecommunications and postal services are in compliance with the Electronic communications act (LEK) as well as other laws relating to telecommunications. The Regulatory body handles issues related to market competition, issuing of licenses, consumer rights as well as network infrastructure regulations. </p>

    <h4 class="Sub_title">EU Regulations</h4>
    <p class="Text">As mentioned before, Sweden follows a set of EU regulations which influence laws concerning telecommunications, etc. Among these regulations are the GDPR (Already discussed), the ePrivacy Directive which has the purpose of ensuring that data during electronic communications are handled with privacy and security, with the regulation specializing in unsolicited marketing and privacy of communications. Along with this is the 2018 Telecoms regulation that updates the governing rules of electronic communications services provisions, such as the internet and mobile services. </p>

    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Swedish Act On The Protection Of Privacy In Electronic Communications</h4>
    <p class="Text">The law details the regulations concerning processing of personal data, making it clear that integrity and confidentiality of communications is upheld when sent through public communication networks. This law applies to data such as cookies and similar tracking methods and requires the provider of services to ask for the consumers consent for data collection and processing along with ensuring the protection of location data. </p>

    <h4 class="Sub_title">The Act on The Interception of Communications</h4>
    <p class="Text">The Act allows law enforcement to intercept and listen in on communications under strict special court ordered circumstances where the interception of specific communications could lead to the solving of criminal investigations and prevention of crime.</p>

    <h4 class="Sub_title">Spam And Unsolicited Communications</h4>
    <p class="Text">When it comes to Sweden's stance on spam and unsolicited communications, it mainly just follows what the EU has outlined in its ePrivacy regulation and GDPR. However, it also follows the Swedish Marketing Act, which makes it unlawful for companies to market through email, phone and other means of electronic communication without any prior consent from the consumer to the service provider. Companies are also forced by law to allow opt out marketing options for consumers, and are otherwise told to only send relevant information to the consumer, according to the consumers preference. </p>


    <h1 class="Points"></h1>
    <h4 class="Sub_title">What Counts As Personal Information</h4>
    <p class="Text">Personal information is a broad term which can relate to almost any and all information relating to an individual, and the reason for this broad definition has to do with the fact that the definition itself contains the words “any information”. However, personal information can be divided into 2 categories, one being general personal information, as discussed above, and the other being sensitive private information which are put at a much higher standard of protection. Sensitive personal information could contain things like an individual's health journal, religious and ideological belief, criminal history and economical history. 
      <br>
      <br>
      Because of how broad personal information really is, it makes things difficult for websites to publish personal information. But, there is both a loophole in the rule and a simple yet effective method. In the EUs definition of protected personal information it is clearly stated that for the information to be personal it must be connected to an identifiable living person, meaning that it no longer becomes personal information when the individual that the information is related to is dead and their information can be published online. In addition to this, websites can also ask for the consent of any living individual to publish their person information without issue. 
      </p>

      <h1 class="Points"></h1>
      <h4 class="Sub_title">The Differences Between The Freedom Of Press Act (TF) And The Freedom Of Expression Act</h4>
      <p class="Text">The Freedom Of Press Act is one of the 4 fundamental laws that make up the constitution of Sweden's government and details the right for individuals, media organisations and journalists to publish information about any and all opinions, news, events, etc without any censorship or interference by the government, so long as it doesn't contain anything insulting, defamatory, slanderous or otherwise secretive such as medical journals and secret documents that could lead to national vulnerabilities. The act also ensures that the public has access to general information related to the state of Sweden and the operations of its government (With the exceptions mentioned above). 
        <br>
        <br>
        The Freedom Of Expression Act is an act that expands upon the previous law by regulating people's right to voice their opinions and sentiments in the context of electronic communications, giving people a much broader scope of protection. This gives the media the right to broadcast their news without interference from the government, ensuring that there is no censorship from the state. The law in general is just a much broader scope of the previous law, focusing more on the right of the individual rather than mainly the media and journalists. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="Sub_title">What Copyright Is</h4>
        <p class="Text">Copyright is essentially the idea that somebody who makes an intellectual property, whether it be something big or small, has the right of ownership and therefore can decide what he and others wanting to use his work can and are allowed to do with it,  so long as the other person who wants to use the copyrighted material is allowed by the owner of the material to do so. Which means that unless someone is given consent by the owner of the material, it is impermissible and illegal for someone to play a movie or stream a song or even post a picture of some sort on a website and can result in the websites revenue being seized by the owner and even the owner of the website being fined. However, there are some exceptions to what copyrights can be applied to, among which consists of ideas, names, methods and systems as well as facts. Something of importance to not is that this right is not permanent, as a matter of fact, after the owner of the copyright dies, a countdown of sorts starts to begin
          and after 70 years the content enters public domain nand is allowed to be used by everyone without consequence. 
          </p>

          <h4 class="Sub_title">Creator Commons</h4>
          <p class="Text">Creator Commons is an international non-profit organization that's dedicated to the mission of providing organizations, individuals and communities with tools and resources that are publicly available to all and is sourced from people willing to submit and share their intellectual property without the need for individual negotiation of its usage every time someone wants to use it. The organization does this by providing so called “CC Licenses” which allow people to use submitted intellectual property within the specified parameters that has been unspecified by the submitter of the property. These licenses can be applied to a wide variety of works, such as music, videos, websites, photos, software and games. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The licenses come in a variety of types, with the following being a small list of them and their meaning:
            <br>
            <br>
            CC BY: Allows the distribution, remix, adaptation and build on of the property submitted, even for commercial usage, so long as the submitter is properly credited. 
            <br>
            <br>
            CC BY-SA: The same as CC BY, but with the added condition of the new creation being licensed under the same conditions as the original property.
            <br>
            <br>
            CC BY-ND: The same as CC BY, but with the added condition that the property is not modified in any way.
            <br>
            <br>
            CC BY-NC: The Same as CC BY, but with the added condition that it is not used commercially.
            <br>
            <br>
            CC BY-NC-SA: Same as CC BY-SA,  but with the added condition that it is not used commercially.
            <br>
            <br>
            CC BY-NC-ND: The same as CC BY-ND,  but with the added condition that it is not used commercially.
