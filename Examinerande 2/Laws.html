  <h4 class="Sub_title">What GDPR Is And Its Principles</h4>
  <p class="Text">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a Data Privacy and Security Law that was legislated in 2016 and made obligatory in 2018. It is to be followed by all entities that collect any and all data related to people within the European Union (EU). It is said to be the world's toughest security law, with anyone found in violation of the law receiving massive fines reaching into the tens of millions of euros or 4% of whatever global revenue a legal entity would make annually. The Law has 7 principles that make up its foundation for the protection of all data related to people within the EU. They are: 
    <br>
    <br>
    Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: Lawful, Transparent and Fair processing of all data related to subjects. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Purpose Limitation: Any and all processing of data must have legitimate purposes that are specified to the subject that the data is extracted from.
    <br>
    <br>
    Data minimization: Only a necessary amount of data is allowed to be collected and processed for the specified purpose.
    <br>
    <br>
    Accuracy: Any and all personal data should be accurate and up to date.
    <br>
    <br>
    Storage Limitation: Any and all personally identifying data should only be stored for as long as necessary for the specific purpose.
    <br>
    <br>
    Integrity And Confidentiality: Appropriate security, caution and confidentiality should be in place when processing data.
    <br>
    <br>
    Accountability: The entity in charge of the processing and usage of the collected data is responsible to be in compliance with the GDPR and its principles.
